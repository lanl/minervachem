3. `pip install -e .`

### Pip Installation 

**This is not recommended**  

Steps: 
1. Clone this repo and `cd` into it.
2. install the package with `pip install -e .`
3. If running demos, install your preferred variant of jupyter

You'll also want to run `pip install -r requirements_developer.txt`

# Getting started with `minervachem`

We recommend looking through and running the notebooks in the `demos/` directory for a detailed introduction to `minervachem`'s funcitonality.

## Highlights

### Constructing graphlet fingerprints

`Fingerprinter` classes provide reusable objects for generating molecular fingerprints, including the graphlet fingerprints described in our manuscript.

```python
from rdkit.Chem import MolFromSmiles, AddHs
from minervachem.fingerprinters import GraphletFingerprinter

# Benzene
mol = AddHs(MolFromSmiles('c1ccccc1'))

# Reusable Fingerprinter object 
fingerprinter = GraphletFingerprinter(max_len=3)

# Fingerprints are a map from fragment IDs to fragment counts.
# The fragments are identified by their number of atoms and a hash.
fp, bi = fingerprinter(mol)
print(fp)
>>> {(3, 10387847931347882557): 6,
>>>  (2, 10630435057451682469): 6,
>>>  (2, 11665740151475091393): 6,
>>>  (3, 14577436124092730684): 12,
>>>  (1, 20784809936286627226): 6,
>>>  (1, 12794648790135253294): 6}

# We can visualize the above dictiory with a plotting method
from minervachem.plotting import plot_fingerprint
plot_fingerprint(mol, fingerprinter)
```

### scikit-learn transformers

We can quickly construct feature matrices for machine learning from a set of molecules using `minervachem`'s provided `sklearn`-style transformers:

```python
from minervachem.transformers import FingerprintFeaturizer

mols = [MolFromSmiles(s) for s in [
    'c1ccccc1',
    'NCNOCOC',
    'CN1C=NC2=C1C(=O)N(C(=O)N2C)C',
    'CNO',
]]

featurizer = FingerprintFeaturizer(
    fingerprinter, 
    n_jobs=2 # parallelism for large datasets
)

# FingerprintFeaturizer implements the sklearn transformer API
feature_matrix = featurizer.fit_transform(mols)
# which generates sparse integer matrices by default
feature_matrix
```
```
>>> <4x39 sparse matrix of type '<class 'numpy.int64'>'
	with 44 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format>
```

### Building Interpretable Machine Learning Models
#### Model fitting

After constructing a dataset through the methods above, we can use `minervachem` to fit an interpretable ML model. 

The below is a snippet from the demo notebook which fits a hierarchical linear model with ~6,000 coefficients to ~100,000 molecules from QM9. 

```python
import minervachem
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from minervachem.regressors import HierarchicalResidualModel
from minervachem.plotting import parity_plot_train_test


# build a higherarchical residual model
# using a ridge regressor base model 
base_model = Ridge(fit_intercept=False, 
                   alpha=1e-5,
                   solver='sparse_cg')
hmodel = HierarchicalResidualModel(regressor=base_model,verbose=1)
hmodel.fit(X_train,y_train,levels=featurizer.bit_sizes_)

# visualize the train and test performance with 
# minervachem's plotting methods
parity_plot_train_test([X_train, X_test], 
                       [y_train, y_test],
                       hmodel, 
                       figsize=(12, 4),
                       xlab='DFT (kcal/mol)', 
                       ylab='Linear Model (kcal/mol)', 
                       title='Hierarchical Model Prediction');   
```

#### Model interpretations
Linear models are interpretable, but 6,000 coefficients is too many to look at all at once. (The most accurate models in our manuscript had >100,000 coefficients.) So, we use `minervachem`'s projection methods to visualize atom- or bond-level contributions to model predictions for a set of molecules. 

First we construct the Directed-Acyclic-Graph (DAG) between molecular graphlets that defines our projection operation:

```python
from minervachem.graphlet_dags import GraphletDAG, draw_projected_coefs

# Construct the DAG relating larger graphlets to smaller ones
# for each molecule
dags = []
for mol in mols:
    dag =  GraphletDAG(mol,
                       fingerprinter=featurizer.fingerprinter, # the fingerprinter that creates the graphlets
                       bit_ids=featurizer.bit_ids_, # The bit ids for the features used in the model training
                       coef=hmodel.coef_ # The model coefficients as an array.
                     )
    dags.append(dag)

draw_projected_coefs(dags,
                     level=2, # bond-level interpretations (atom-level is 1)
                    )
```
